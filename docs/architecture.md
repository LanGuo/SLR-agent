# SLR Agent — Architecture

## Overview

The pipeline is a **LangGraph state machine** with seven stage subgraphs wired through a central orchestrator. Each stage writes its results to SQLite and emits a JSON file to disk. At configured stages, the orchestrator pauses for human review before continuing.

Three cross-cutting components sit alongside the pipeline:

- **`CheckpointBroker`** — coordinates pause/resume between the pipeline thread and the human (CLI prompts or Gradio UI)
- **`ProgressEmitter`** — fans out stage events to CLI echo, Gradio live log queue, and `outputs/<run_id>/stage_N_<name>.json`
- **`Database`** — SQLite store for `PaperRecord` (one row per paper per run) and the quarantine table

## State Design

### OrchestratorState (LangGraph graph state)

Intentionally slim — holds routing signals and summary counts only. All bulk evidence lives in SQLite.

```python
class OrchestratorState(TypedDict):
    run_id: str
    raw_question: str
    config: RunConfig
    pico: PICOResult | None

    synthesis_path: str | None
    manuscript_path: str | None
    template: dict | None
    manuscript_draft_version: int
    date_from: str | None          # search date range, e.g. "2000-01-01"

    search_language: str       # always "en"
    output_language: str       # same as source_language
```

### RunConfig

```python
class RunConfig(TypedDict, total=False):
    checkpoint_stages: list[int]   # default [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
    fetch_fulltext: bool

```

### PaperRecord (SQLite only)

```python
class PaperRecord(TypedDict):
    pmid: str              # "99999" for PubMed; "biorxiv:10.1101/..." for bioRxiv
    run_id: str
    title: str
    abstract: str
    fulltext: str | None
    source: Literal["abstract", "fulltext"]
    screening_decision: Literal["include", "exclude", "uncertain", "excluded_manual"]

    quarantined_fields: list[QuarantinedField]
```

## HITL Mechanism

### CheckpointBroker

The broker sits between the pipeline thread and the human. The pipeline calls `broker.pause(stage, name, data)` and blocks. The broker delegates to its handler:

- **`NoOpHandler`** — returns data unchanged (fully automated)
- **`CLIHandler`** — prints formatted data, prompts Approve/Edit/Skip, uses `click.prompt` for field-by-field inline editing
- **`UIHandler`** — pushes data to a `Queue`, blocks on a `threading.Event` until Gradio calls `ui_handler.resume(edited_data)`

```
pipeline thread          broker                  human
     │                     │                       │
     │── pause(3, data) ──▶│                       │
     │                     │── push to queue ──────▶│
     │   (blocks)          │                       │  [reviews in Gradio / CLI]
     │                     │◀── resume(edited) ────│
     │◀── returns edited ──│                       │
     │                     │                       │
```

### Stage 2 — Search gate

After retrieval, all papers are surfaced at `broker.pause(2, "search", data)`:

- Set `excluded=true` on any paper to remove it before LLM screening (`screening_decision` → `excluded_manual`)
- Add a paper by PMID by including an entry with `manual_add=true` — the pipeline fetches its abstract from PubMed

### Stage 3 — Two-gate screening

Stage 3 has two broker calls: one before screening (criteria review) and one after (per-paper decision review):

1. LLM generates inclusion/exclusion criteria from PICO
2. `broker.pause(3, "screening_criteria", criteria)` — user edits criteria
3. Criteria saved to `stage_3_screening_criteria.json`
4. Screening subgraph runs with user-edited criteria
5. `broker.pause(3, "screening", decisions)` — user reviews per-paper decisions

**Screening prompt — strict exclusion rules:**
In addition to the user-edited criteria, every screening prompt enforces 5 strict rules:
1. The intervention must be the PRIMARY focus — incidental mentions → EXCLUDE
2. Outcomes must include observed endpoint data — surrogate-only studies → EXCLUDE
3. Protocol/design papers with no reported results → EXCLUDE
4. Narrative reviews and non-systematic guideline summaries → EXCLUDE
5. "uncertain" only when the abstract genuinely lacks information; default to EXCLUDE

**Batch size and retry:** Controlled by `RunConfig["screening_batch_size"]` (default 3). After each batch LLM call, any PMID that did not receive a decision is retried individually. This guarantees full coverage even when the LLM truncates its output.

**Criterion scoring:** For each paper the LLM returns a `criterion_scores` list — one entry per criterion — with `met` (`yes`/`no`/`unclear`) and a `note` quoting the relevant abstract span. The overall `decision` is then **derived algorithmically** from the scores (not from the LLM's free-form verdict):
- Any exclusion criterion `met=yes` → `exclude`
- Any inclusion criterion `met=no` → `exclude`
- Study designs specified and none matched → `exclude`
- Any `unclear` score (when not already excluded) → `uncertain`
- All criteria met → `include`

The LLM's `decision` field is used only as a fallback when no criterion scores are returned.

**Gate B — Screening HITL panel (UI mode):** Filter radio (All / Include / Uncertain / Exclude), non-interactive dataframe of decisions, expandable detail panel showing full title, abstract (up to 2,000 characters), AI reason, and criterion scorecard. The scorecard uses `[IN]`/`[EX]`/`[SD]` type labels and `✓`/`✗`/`?` met indicators with per-criterion notes. Per-paper ✓ Include / ? Uncertain / ✗ Exclude buttons override decisions before final approval.

### Stage 7 — Revision loop

Stage 7 runs in a loop while the user keeps requesting revisions:

1. Manuscript subgraph generates draft + rubric scores
2. `broker.pause(7, "manuscript", {draft, rubric, draft_version})` — user reviews
3. User has three editing modes (all combinable before approving):
   - **Direct edit** — the draft code block is fully editable; user changes markdown inline
   - **Section rewrite** — user names a section (e.g. `Methods`) and types a freeform instruction; the LLM rewrites just that section body in-place (no broker round-trip, updates the draft display immediately)
   - **Full revise** — `action == "revise"`: re-runs the manuscript subgraph → new versioned draft → loops back to step 2
4. `action == "approve"`: exit loop. If the draft was directly edited or section-rewritten, the `edited_draft` is written to disk and re-exported to `.docx` before finalising.

---

## Grounding Layer

Every LLM-extracted value is verified against its source text before being stored. The goal is to catch hallucinations — values the LLM invented rather than derived from the paper.

### Decision flow

```
extracted_value
    │
    ├── len < 20 chars? ──▶ exact substring search
    │                           ├── found → grounded (confidence=100)
    │                           └── not found → quarantined (confidence=0)
    │
    └── len ≥ 20 chars? ──▶ token_set_ratio vs full source text
                                ├── score ≥ threshold → locate span in sentence chunks → grounded
                                └── score < threshold → quarantined
```

### Metric: `token_set_ratio`

`token_set_ratio` (rapidfuzz) sorts both strings into token sets before comparing. This handles word-order differences and paraphrasing — common when extracting from abstracts, which summarise full-text findings in different phrasing. `partial_ratio` (character-order sensitive) was used previously and incorrectly quarantined correct paraphrased extractions.

### Source-adaptive threshold

Abstracts are paraphrased summaries; full text is verbatim. A single threshold produces too many false quarantines on abstract-sourced papers:

| Source | Threshold |
|---|---|
| `abstract` | 75 |
| `fulltext` | 85 |

The threshold can be overridden by passing `threshold=N` to `ExtractionGrounder()`.

### Short value handling

Fuzzy matching on strings shorter than 20 characters (e.g. sample sizes like `"96"`, durations like `"4 weeks"`) is unreliable — the score is dominated by token overlap noise. These are handled with exact case-insensitive substring search instead.

### Span location

When a value passes the threshold check, its location in the source text is recorded as a `Span(char_start, char_end, text)` for provenance. Span location uses **sentence-level chunking** (windows of 3 sentences scored with `token_set_ratio`) rather than a character-by-character sliding window, which was O(n) fuzzy calls for a 6000-character source text.

### Quarantine behaviour

- Quarantined fields are stored, not dropped — the paper is not discarded
- `extracted_data` contains only grounded fields; quarantined fields are in `quarantined_fields`
- They appear at the Stage 5 HITL gate for manual resolution
- PRISMA flow diagram includes quarantine counts as a data quality signal
- Full quarantine table queryable via SQLite or `slr status <run_id>`

### LLM-based grounding (Stage 5 gate)

Fuzzy matching fails on valid extractions that are heavily paraphrased, abbreviated, or expressed differently (e.g. `"96"` vs `"ninety-six"`, `"MI"` vs `"myocardial infarction"`). At the Stage 5 gate the user can check **LLM ground** on any paper to trigger a second-pass LLM grounding run on that paper's quarantined fields:

1. For each quarantined field, the LLM is asked: *"Does the source text support this value, even if phrased differently?"*
2. Fields confirmed (`supported: true`) are moved into `extracted_data`
3. Fields not confirmed remain quarantined

This is intentionally separate from re-extraction — the extracted value itself is not changed, only its quarantine status.

### Synthesis grounding (Stage 6)

A separate LLM-based grounding step: Gemma is asked to cite the PMIDs that support each synthesised claim. Claims with zero citations are quarantined. This is semantic rather than lexical — appropriate for synthesised statements that combine evidence across papers.

---

## Search Design

### PubMed (Entrez)

- One Entrez `esearch` call per query string in `pico.query_strings`
- `mindate` / `maxdate` / `datetype=pdat` for date range filtering
- `efetch` in batches of 200 to retrieve titles + abstracts
- Rate limiting: 3 req/s without API key, 10 req/s with key

#### Result cap and relevance ordering

PubMed returns results in **relevance order** by default (best matches first within each query). The per-query cap uses **2× headroom** to compensate for overlap between PICO-derived query strings (which frequently retrieve the same papers):

```
per_query_cap = max_results // len(query_strings) * 2
```

After merging (deduplicating by PMID), a final slice enforces the hard cap:

```
all_pmids = list(ordered_union_of_all_queries)[:max_results]
```

The cap is applied to the **total** retrieved, not per-query. Without the 2× factor, heavily overlapping queries (e.g. three variations of "aspirin cardiovascular") would yield far fewer unique PMIDs than `max_results` after deduplication.

**`n_pubmed` vs `n_retrieved`:** `n_pubmed` in `SearchCounts` counts papers actually stored (from `efetch` `PubmedArticle` records). This is lower than the esearch PMID count because some PMIDs correspond to letters, errata, and editorial notes that have no `Abstract` element in the XML. `n_retrieved = n_pubmed + n_biorxiv`.

### bioRxiv

- Date-range API: `https://api.biorxiv.org/details/biorxiv/{date_from}/{date_to}/0/json`
- No keyword search API — fetches recent preprints by date range, capped at `max_results`
- PICO relevance filtering happens in Stage 3 screening (LLM-based), not at retrieval time
- Failures (network, timeout, non-200 HTTP) emit a `RuntimeWarning` and the pipeline continues with PubMed results only

#### Combined volume

With both sources enabled, the total paper count entering screening can be up to `2 × max_results` (PubMed cap + bioRxiv cap independently). Set `search_sources: ["pubmed"]` to stay within `max_results` total.

### Search configuration (user-editable at Stage 1 gate)

`search_sources`, `max_results`, `date_from`, `date_to` are all exposed at the Stage 1 PICO gate. User edits flow into state and are used by the search subgraph at Stage 2.

---

## Manuscript Template System

Three template formats all normalize to the same internal representation:

```json
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "name": "Methods",
      "instructions": "Describe search strategy and eligibility criteria.",
      "rubric_criteria": ["Specifies inclusion/exclusion criteria", "Names all databases searched"]
    }
  ],
  "style_notes": "Use passive voice. Max 6000 words."
}
```

| Format | How parsed |
|---|---|
| JSON schema | Direct parse — no LLM call |
| PDF (reference paper) | PyMuPDF text extraction → Gemma 4 infers sections, style, rubric criteria |
| None | Built-in PRISMA 2020 default (`DEFAULT_PRISMA_TEMPLATE`) |

**Two-pass generation:**
1. **Draft pass** — the LLM writes each section guided by its `instructions`
2. **Rubric pass** — the LLM scores each criterion (`met` / `partial` / `not met` + explanation)

The Stage 7 HITL gate shows the scored rubric alongside the draft. Triggering a revision re-runs Pass 1 targeting only `partial` / `not met` sections.

### Hallucination prevention

Each section prompt includes a `search_context` block containing only factual pipeline data, with explicit instructions not to invent any details:

- Exact databases searched, date range, and query strings (from run state)
- Exact PRISMA flow counts (retrieved, screened, excluded, included)
- Accurate pipeline description: AI-assisted, GRADE (not Cochrane RoB 2.0 or NOS), narrative synthesis (no meta-analysis, no forest plots), no named human reviewers, no reference management software, no supplementary tables

This prevents the most common manuscript hallucinations: invented database names, fake reviewer names, wrong risk-of-bias tools, and bracketed placeholders like `[Table 1]`.

### Pre-generated tables

Study characteristics and GRADE evidence tables are generated directly from the SQLite paper records (no LLM), then appended verbatim to the matching manuscript sections:

- `_build_study_table(papers)` → appended to any section whose name contains "study characteristics" or "characteristics of included studies"
- `_build_grade_table(papers)` → appended to any section whose name contains "risk of bias", "quality assessment", or "grade assessment"

This ensures tables contain exact extracted values rather than LLM paraphrases.

---

## ProgressEmitter

`ProgressEmitter` is the event sink that decouples the pipeline from its consumers. Every stage calls `emitter.emit(stage, data)` on completion and `emitter.log(message)` for progress updates.

Each call fans out to:

1. **Disk** — `outputs/<run_id>/stage_N_<name>.json` (always)
2. **CLI** — `click.echo` (if `echo` provided)
3. **Gradio** — put to `Queue` polled by `gr.Timer(N).tick()` (if Gradio is running; Gradio 6 removed `app.load(every=N)`)

The `name` parameter overrides the default stage name for custom filenames (e.g., `stage_3_screening_criteria.json` vs `stage_3_screening.json`).

---

## SQLite Checkpointer

LangGraph's `SqliteSaver` is used as the graph checkpointer. After every node completion, full graph state is persisted to `slr_runs.db`. This enables `slr resume <run_id>` to re-enter at the exact node where the run paused or failed.

**Important:** `SqliteSaver` must be constructed as `SqliteSaver(conn)` with an already-open `sqlite3.connect()` connection. `SqliteSaver.from_conn_string()` is a context manager (yields, doesn't return) and cannot be used directly outside a `with` block.

---

## Gradio UI Panel Design

`build_app_with_handler(ui_handler, run_id, llm)` builds the HITL review UI. A single `gr.Timer(1).tick()` polls `UIHandler.get_pending()` and routes to one of four stage-specific panel groups based on `cp["stage"]`:

| Stage(s) | Panel | Components |
|---|---|---|
| 1, 3, 6 | Generic | Editable `gr.Code(language="json")` block + Approve button |
| 2 | Search | `gr.Dataframe` with Exclude bool column; PMID add textbox; Approve button |
| 5 | Extraction | `gr.Dataframe` with Exclude/LLM ground bool columns; row-click shows extracted and quarantined fields in two `gr.Code` panels |
| 7 | Manuscript | Editable draft (`gr.Code`, interactive); section-rewrite accordion (section name + instruction → LLM rewrites section in-place); rubric scores; Approve / Full Revise buttons |

**Implementation notes:**
- `gr.Group` is used for visibility toggling (not `gr.Column`) — Gradio 6 requires `gr.Group` for `visible` updates to propagate correctly; panels use `elem_classes="checkpoint-panel"` with CSS `height: auto` to prevent flex-stretch layout issues
- `gr.Timer(N).tick()` replaces the removed `app.load(every=N)` from Gradio 5
- `gr.Dataframe` uses `column_count=(N, "fixed")` (the `col_count` parameter was deprecated in Gradio 6); `max_height=250` keeps tables scrollable without pushing buttons off-screen
- `poll_checkpoint` returns 15 values matching its `outputs=` list (3 added for the Stage 2 search panel)
- `papers_state = gr.State([])` holds full paper dicts between the timer tick and the row-select handler, avoiding redundant DB reads
- Section rewrite runs entirely inside the Gradio handler (calls `_llm.chat()` directly) — no broker round-trip required; the updated draft is passed back via `edited_draft` only on Approve

---

## Trajectory Logging (TraceWriter)

Every run writes two append-only JSONL trace files alongside the stage output files:

```
outputs/<run_id>/
  llm_trace.jsonl    — one entry per Ollama call
  hitl_trace.jsonl   — one entry per HITL gate interaction
```

### `llm_trace.jsonl`

Each line is a JSON object recording the full context of one `LLMClient.chat()` call:

```json
{
  "ts": 1712345678.123,
  "model": "gemma4:e4b",
  "think": true,
  "attempt": 1,
  "n_messages": 1,
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are screening abstracts..."}],
  "schema_keys": ["decision", "pmid", "reason"],
  "thinking": "The abstract describes a randomised trial. The population...",
  "response": "{\"decisions\": [...]}",
  "latency_s": 4.217,
  "prompt_tokens": 312,
  "completion_tokens": 89,
  "error": null
}
```

Fields:
- `messages` — the full prompt including PICO context and batch text
- `thinking` — Gemma 4's reasoning chain (only present when `think=True`; `null` otherwise)
- `schema_keys` — sorted list of required output fields (avoids duplicating the full schema in every entry)
- `error` — non-null only on failed attempts (e.g. `"JSONDecodeError: ..."`); a successful retry after a failed attempt produces two entries for the same logical call
- `prompt_tokens` / `completion_tokens` — from Ollama's `prompt_eval_count` / `eval_count` response fields; `null` if not reported

### `hitl_trace.jsonl`

Each line records one broker gate interaction (called even in `NoOpHandler` mode so automated runs are traceable):

```json
{
  "ts": 1712345890.456,
  "stage": 3,
  "stage_name": "screening",
  "action": "approve",
  "n_changes": 2,
  "diff": {
    "papers": {
      "before": [{"pmid": "99999", "decision": "uncertain", ...}],
      "after":  [{"pmid": "99999", "decision": "include",   ...}]
    }
  },
  "before": { ... },
  "after":  { ... }
}
```

Fields:
- `diff` — only keys whose values changed between what the pipeline produced and what the user returned; the `action` key is excluded from the diff
- `n_changes` — number of changed keys (0 = pure approve with no edits)
- `before` / `after` — full snapshots for complete auditability

### Wiring

`TraceWriter` is instantiated once per run in `_build_orchestrator` (in `cli.py`) using `emitter.run_dir` as the target directory. The same instance is injected into both `LLMClient` and `CheckpointBroker`:

```python
trace_writer = TraceWriter(emitter.run_dir)
llm = LLMClient(model=..., trace_writer=trace_writer)
broker._trace = trace_writer
```

`TraceWriter` does not hold open file handles — each `write_*` call opens, appends one line, and closes. This is safe under the GIL for single-process runs.

### Use cases

| Task | Which file | How |
|---|---|---|
| Replay a screening decision | `llm_trace.jsonl` | Find entries where `schema_keys` contains `"decision"` |
| Inspect Gemma 4 reasoning chain | `llm_trace.jsonl` | Filter `"think": true`, read `"thinking"` field |
| See what a user changed at a gate | `hitl_trace.jsonl` | Filter by `"stage"`, read `"diff"` |
| Measure LLM latency per stage | `llm_trace.jsonl` | Aggregate `"latency_s"` by prompt content |
| Identify JSON retry failures | `llm_trace.jsonl` | Filter `"error": {"$ne": null}` |
| Token usage per run | `llm_trace.jsonl` | Sum `"prompt_tokens"` + `"completion_tokens"` |

## Testing Strategy

| Layer | Tool | Ollama needed |
|---|---|---|
| Unit tests | pytest + MockLLM | No |
| Integration tests | pytest + MockLLM | No |
| E2E smoke test | pytest -m e2e | Yes |

`MockLLM` matches prompts by substring (case-sensitive `in` check) and returns pre-registered structured responses. Tests register keys matching the start of each LLM prompt.

Grounding regression test: injects a `PaperRecord` with a deliberately hallucinated extracted field (no matching span) and verifies the grounding node quarantines it rather than passing it through.
